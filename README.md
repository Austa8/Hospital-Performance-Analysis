[Hospital Performance Analysis]{https://github.com/Austa8/Hospital-Performance-Analysis}
The analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and Power Point, with a focus on anaylizing certain key criteria for hospital performance and optimization of healthcare services based on the following criteria:

• Demographic Patterns
Which age cohort exhibits the highest hospitalization rates?
What age group experiences the highest mortality within the hospital?
• Gender Dynamics
Which gender is the most prevalent in the hospital?
• Health Condition Exploration
How many patients died in the hospital with atrial fibrillation?
How many patients in the hospital have depression?
What is the rate of non-survived patients with hypertension?
• Mortality Rates
How many patients are alive in the hospital with renal failure?
How many patients are dead in the hospital with Hyperlipemia ?
How many patients are dead in the hospital with Anemia?

Through meticulous data analysis, we aim to illuminate pathways for enhancing hospital strategies and interventions, ultimately fostering improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
